           For teachers looking for additional exercises, we have compiled many activities for students 
           to go deeper into the material. Have students use composition and coordinates to create flags for 
           their countries of origin, or for a country they want to make up! 
           Have them use @emph{randomness} and @emph{trigonometric functions} for more sophisticated motion, 
           or introduce @emph{data structures} for more sophisticated games!}

Of course, there's more to a curriculum than software and lesson plans! We also provide a number of resources to educators, including standards alignment, an answer key for the programming exercises and forums where they can ask questions and share ideas.

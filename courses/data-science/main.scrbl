@boxed-text{@animated-gif{splash.png}What makes your favorite athlete the Greatest of All Time?  How would you determine the most 
             successful musician ever?  How is the population of your country changing?  Answering these questions involves 
             collecting and manipulating data, from sports stats to record sales to census data.  Our Data Science module teaches 
             students to view programs as questions we ask of data.  Students form their own questions about the world around them, 
             and learn how to analyze data critically and carefully to find answers.  Business, science, and history teachers can 
             utilize this module to help students make inferences from data.  Math teachers can use this module to introduce 
             foundational concepts in statistics.  It also works great as a module for AP CS Principles' unit on data!}

This directory stores files that are no longer part of the active
build, but that we may want to refer back to at some point.  For
example, some of the early lesson files are in here (when we were
playing around with javascript based interaction within lessons).

The copy of form-elements.rkt in this directory was saved at the time
when we began moving items into the attic.  It should therefore have
all scribble functions mentioned in these files (though the current
form-elements file has been cleaned up).

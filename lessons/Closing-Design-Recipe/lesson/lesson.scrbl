Then you come up with examples of how the finished product should look, and write a template using only what you know. Only then do you solve!}
            @item{Engineers use this when they design cars, by testing each part before putting them together. Journalists use this when they write articles, by making an outline to be sure that each paragraph makes sense before fitting it into a story. Chefs use it when they make food, tasting each part of a dish before assembling it into a meal. Everyone, in every profession, needs to solve problems, and being able to break complex problems down into simpler parts is the key to being good at solving them. To succeed in this class, you need to be masters of solving Word Problems. Fortunately, you've got the Design Recipe on your side. Once you've got the recipe down, you'll be able to tackle anything!}

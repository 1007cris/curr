    2. Give Examples
    Write an example of your function for each topping, using EXAMPLE
    
        (EXAMPLE (@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "Use the function here"]) @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "What should the function produce"])
    
        (EXAMPLE (@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "Use the function here"]) @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "What should the function produce"])
    
        (EXAMPLE (@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "Use the function here"]) @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "What should the function produce"])
    
        (EXAMPLE (@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "Use the function here"]) @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "What should the function produce"])
    
    3. Function Header
    Write the function Header, giving variable names to all your input values.
    
    (define (@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "function name"] @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "variable names"])(
    
        @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "COND"]
     
        @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "COND1"]@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "Answer1"]
    
        @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "COND2"]@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "Answer2"]
    
        @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "COND3"]@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "Answer3"]
    
        @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "COND4"]@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "Answer4"]
    
        @fill-in-the-blank[#:id "COND5"]@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "Answer5"]

		<h1>Standards Alignment</h1>
      <p>Extra lessons are nice, but Math teachers don't <i>have</i> 25 hours of spare classtime to spend on new materials, no matter how good it might be.
      <p>That's why Bootstrap is aligned to Common Core Standards for Mathematics, covering most Functional and Algebraic standards across the Common Core from Grade 7 through Algebra 2. This alignment makes it possible to integrate Bootstrap into the classroom smoothly, using time you've already planned into your pacing guidelines or scope and sequence plans.
      
      <p>Bootstrap is also a model implementation of Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice, offering explicit pedgagogical recommendation across all eight practice standards.
      <p>Choose the course you're interested in by clicking one of the buttons below. <b>We've highlighted the Functional (F) and Algebraic (A)</b> standards in the Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 tables, to show Bootstrap's target coverage.

          <td class="col">
            Bootstrap students are confronted with challenging problems, and use a problem-solving methodology known as the <i>Design Recipe</i> to solve them. The recipe teaches critical thinking, asking students to write down what they know and think through each step on their way to a solution.

          <td>Reason abstractly and quantitatively</td>

          <td class="col">
            Teachers engage students in discussion about each step in the Design Recipe, asking them to explain how they move from one step to another. In addition, students are challenged to debug the code of others, not just by identifying programmatic flaws but by also identifying faulty reasoning.

          <td>Model with mathematics</td>
          <td class="col">
            When Bootstrap students want their characters to move, to stay onscreen or collide with one another, they must first model that behavior mathematically. And since the programming language is purely algebraic, these models become the programs themselves!

          <td>Use appropriate tools strategically</td>
          <td class="col">
            Even programmers know that a computer isn't the perfect tool for every situation. Bootstrap students draw graphical diagrams, write out written examnples, and use the computer <i>when the situation calls for it</i>.

          <td>Attend to precision</td>
          <td class="col">
            Communicating precisely is key, whether you're a mathematician or a professional progammer. In Bootstrap, students consider datatypes, select clear function and variable names, and write comments for their code.

        <tr>
          <td>Look for and make use of structure</td>
          <td class="col">
            Bootstrap students look closely at worked-out examples before generalizing to a formula, as part of the Design Recipe. When working with the Circles of Evaluation, students consider the structure of arithmetic expressions as functions being composed on one another -- and this structure becomes the basis for their code.

          <td>Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning</td>
          <td class="col">
            By practicing the Design Recipe repeatedly, students begin to discern the connection between multiple representations of functions. They notice patterns in the examples they write and contracts they derive.

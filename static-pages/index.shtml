		<h1>Materials</h1>
    <p>If you're a math teacher, and are looking for a fun way for students to practice and apply what they've learned, or a programming teacher who is looking for a rigorous introduction to basic functions and datatypes, you'll find <b><a href="courses/bs1/main.shtml">Bootstrap:1</a></b> to be a perfect fit! All of our lessons are <a href="Standards.shtml">aligned to Common Core Standards for Mathematics</a> -- including the new standards for Mathematical Practice!


      <p>If you're looking for a full-blown programming class, and want students to have the freedom to create more advanced games using data structures, events, and more, you'll want to continue to the second module (<b><a href="courses/bs2/main.shtml">Bootstrap:2</a></b>) to build on what students have done in the introductory course. We've listed the breakdown of concepts in the table below - take a look to find the best fit for you!
      <table width="100%">
        <thead>
          <tr><td class="col"></td><td>Mathematics</td><td>Programming</td></tr>

            <b><a href="courses/bs1/main.shtml">Starting with Bootstrap:1...</a></b>
            <p/>Students create a simple, 3-character game involving a player, a target and a danger. They design what each character looks like, and use algebraic concepts to detect collisions, handle keystrokes, and determine how they move and interact.

            <p/>Students learn how the world-based event loop that drives their Bootstrap 1 game works, and use it to create animations using simple datatypes for their world. They then learn about data structures, and design a World structure for a sophisticated game of their own design.

        <h1>After Bootstrap...</h1>
        
      If you've completed the entire Bootstrap curriculum, you'll be happy to know that your class can move on to advanced material, without needing to learn a new language! Here are just a few of the options available to Bootstrap teachers:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://picturingprograms.com/">Picturing Programs</a> focuses heavily on images and animation, as students explore recursion, lists, trees and algorithms -- all using the same language and Design Recipe they've learned in Bootstrap.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/">How to Design Programs</a> is a textbook aimed at more college-level audiences, going beyond the material covered in Picturing Programs. HtDP is currently in its second edition, and the material is being actively updated.</li>
      </ul>

        <h1>Software</h1>
        
        Bootstrap uses <a href="http://www.wescheme.org">WeScheme</a>, a cloud-based IDE that requires <b>no downloading or installation</b>. Anyone with a Gmail account can start developing with WeScheme, storing and retrieving files from the cloud and doing all of their editing in a modern browser. Additionally, WeScheme programs can be shared simply by sending out a link, or posting it to sites such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc.
        <p/>
        Want to run everything locally? Bootstrap also supports <a href="http://www.drracket.org/">DrRacket</a>, a multi-platform graphical environment.  DrRacket runs on all major platforms (Windows, OS X, Unix/Linux) and programs written for one platform run seamlessly on the others, supporting a wide variety of classroom and home computing scenarios.  Its emphasis on beginner-friendly features and support for images makes it ideal for Bootstrap.
